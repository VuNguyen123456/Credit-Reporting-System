# Credit-Reporting-System

Project Overview: Credit Reporting System
This project focuses on developing a Credit Reporting System to process raw credit data files from multiple banks and generate detailed credit reports. The system handles CSV input files, validates data accuracy, and prevents errors in reports. It is designed to be scalable, reliable, and capable of managing large datasets efficiently.

The system uses Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Hash Tables to organize, process, and retrieve data. These structures support tasks such as sorting and validation, ensuring the system handles high data volumes without performance issues.

Input File Format
Credit data files follow a specific naming format: <CreditorID>_<YearMonth>.csv. For example, C090_202408.csv indicates data from creditor C090 for August 2024. Each CSV file contains fields like SSN, Name, Job Title, Employer, LoanID, Card Type, Credit Limit, Used Amount, and Status.

System Features
The system validates input files to ensure data integrity, verifying fields such as SSN, LoanID, and numeric values. It flags duplicates and errors for accurate reporting. Output reports summarize individual credit details, highlighting issues detected during validation.

Scalability and Efficiency
Built for scalability, the system efficiently processes data from multiple files and reporting periods. Its use of optimized data structures ensures quick lookups, seamless report generation, and reliable performance, making it suitable for growing data requirements.
